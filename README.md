# HTML_CSS_JavaScript
General Notes for UI and UX - some are broken and are meant to be fixed to use... 

FIles are generally intended to show interaction with JavaScript and various odd ball examples like;

--Loading HTML navigation URL links from JSON external file with XmlHttpRequest; could tie into FOR JSON with Microsoft SQL server qquery output with BCP to file?

--Or using HTML Drag and Drop to trigger other events - what Kanban Boards need.

Why do these things - Learn - Grow - Experiment
